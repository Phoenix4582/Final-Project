# Final Project
UoB MSc Final Project. Only contains code backbones for neural network models. Datasets and weights unavailable due to size and quantity. **_May not run directly due to the loss of dataset_**

# Bibilography
The project implemented the examples and code from the following repositories:

[Pytorch-MaskRCNN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html)

[Pytorch-YOLOv3](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3)

[Pytorch-RetinaNet](https://github.com/yhenon/pytorch-retinanet)

[Python-Optical Flow](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_video/py_lucas_kanade/py_lucas_kanade.html)
